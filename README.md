# Tensorflow-MNIST
This repository provides a simple example of using TensorFlow to build a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) commonly used for training various image processing systems.
